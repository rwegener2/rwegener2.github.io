# About Me

I am a software engineer and graduate researcher at the intersection of earth science and cloud technology. My background is working with geospatial data at scale, with a particular focus on satellite data. I gained this experience in my role at Maxar and through a variety of NASA collaborations. My time at Development Seed built a lasting belief in the power of Open Source Software and Open Science through collaborations with NASA and the Pangeo community. User engagement and collaborative development are core to my problem solving style.

I am currently in the University of Maryland Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic science where I continue to blend my skills in science and software while developing my interest in cross-organizational applied science. I am also a developer on the icepyx software package and I coordinate coding infrastructure and instruction for the NASA SARP summer internship.
